How to Report a Potential Vulnerability?
========================================

If you would like to report a public issue (for example, one with a released
CVE number), please report it as a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/AudioReach/meta-audioreach/issues/new).
If you have a patch ready, submit it following the same procedure as any
other patch as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you are dealing with a not-yet released or urgent issue, please send a
message to one of the maintainers listed in the [README](README.md).
Include as many details as possible:
  - the layer or software module affected
  - the recipe and its version
  - any example code, if available
